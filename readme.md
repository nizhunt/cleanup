This program is a Node.js script designed to recursively search through a specified directory and its subdirectories to find and delete any `node_modules` directories. This can be useful for freeing up space on your system, as `node_modules` directories often occupy a significant amount of disk space, especially in projects with numerous dependencies.

The script is initiated from the terminal by providing a directory path as a command line argument. It then traverses the specified directory, identifying any `node_modules` directories and deleting them.

> Please exercise caution when running this script, as deleting `node_modules` directories can break dependent projects, and ensure you have backups or a clear understanding of the dependencies in your projects before executing this script.

To make this script executable from anywhere in the terminal, you would need to do the following steps:

1. **Add a Shebang Line**:
   The first line of your script should be a shebang line that tells the system how to execute the script. In this case, it should point to Node.js.

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   You'll need to modify the file permissions to make it executable.

```bash
chmod +x cleanup.js
```

3. **Move the Script to a Directory in Your PATH**:
   Finally, you'll need to move your script to a directory that's in your system's PATH, or add the directory containing your script to your PATH. A common location to place such scripts is `/usr/local/bin`. You might want to rename your script to something more convenient, like `cleanup`, during this step.

```bash
mv cleanup.js /usr/local/bin/cleanup
```

Now you should be able to run your script from anywhere just by typing `cleanup` followed by the directory path you want to clean up.

Here's your updated script:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

function deleteNodeModules(dir) {
  fs.readdir(dir, (err, files) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    for (const file of files) {
      const filePath = path.join(dir, file);
      fs.stat(filePath, (err, stats) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        if (stats.isDirectory()) {
          if (file === "node_modules") {
            fs.rm(filePath, { recursive: true, force: true }, (err) => {
              if (err) throw err;
              console.log(`Deleted node_modules at: ${filePath}`);
            });
          } else {
            deleteNodeModules(filePath);
          }
        }
      });
    }
  });
}

const dir = process.argv[2];
if (dir) {
  deleteNodeModules(dir);
} else {
  console.error("Please provide a directory address.");
}
```

Please be cautious while using this script as it can delete important directories if not used properly.
